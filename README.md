# Testing Concurrent Programs  
## Applying the Coupon Collector’s Problem to Concurrent Programs in Java

## Weighted Random Walk Applying the Coupon Collector’s Problem

This project implements a **weighted random walk** for testing concurrent Java
programs, based on the **Coupon Collector’s Problem**. The approach provides
*probabilistic guarantees* on bug detection by biasing the exploration of
concurrent executions toward previously uncovered behaviors.

The algorithm is implemented as an extension to the **Java Pathfinder (JPF)**
core and is realized through custom `Search` and `Listener` classes.

## Running Experiments

This project includes experiments comparing the proposed approach against
both **standard model checking with JPF** and **native execution on the JVM**.

The experimental subjects are organized into three benchmark projects:

- **CupTest**
- **HashMaps**
- **SctBench**

### Executing Experiments

All experiments can be executed using the following command:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_experiments.py

python3 scripts/generate_plots.py

python3 scripts/generate_tabulars.py

```

All plots and tabulars can be generated by the following commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_plots.py

python3 scripts/generate_tabulars.py

```
## Requirements

To run this project, the following tools are required:

- **Java 11** – required because the included JPF core is compatible with Java 11.  
  (For more information, see [JPF Core](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core))  

- **Gradle** – needed to build and run the benchmark projects used in the experiments.

- **Python 3** – required to run the experiment scripts and generate plots/tables.  
  The necessary Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
